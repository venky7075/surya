<body><pre>If stung by a bee, immediately remove the stinger by scraping it out with a fingernail or the blunt edge of a credit card, then wash the area with soap and water and apply a cold compress.  
Here's a more detailed breakdown:  

* Remove the Stinger:  
	• Scrape it out: Gently scrape the stinger out with your fingernail or the blunt edge of a credit card, a knife, or other similar object.  
	• Avoid squeezing: Do not use tweezers or pinch the stinger, as this may release more venom.  

* Clean the Area:  
	• Wash with soap and water: Clean the sting site thoroughly with soap and water.  

* Apply Cold Compress:  
	• Reduce swelling and pain: Apply a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a cloth to the sting site for 10-20 minutes to reduce swelling and pain.  

* Other Helpful Measures:  
	• Elevate the area: If the sting is on an arm or leg, elevate it to help reduce swelling.  
	• Over-the-counter medications: Consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and antihistamines for itching. 
	• Topical treatments: You can apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream to ease itching and swelling.  

* When to Seek Medical Attention: 
	• Severe allergic reaction: If you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. 
	• Multiple stings: If you have multiple stings, especially if you are a child, older adult, or have heart or breathing problems, seek medical attention.</pre>
